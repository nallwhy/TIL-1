# Foundation of algorithms exercises

## Chapter 1

### 1. Write an algorithm that finds the largest number in a list (an array) of n numbers.



2. Write an algorithm that finds the m smallest numbers in a list of n numbers.3. Write an algorithm that prints out all the subsets of three elements of a set of n elements. Theelements of this set are stored in a list that is the input to the algorithm.4. Write an Insertion Sort algorithm (Insertion Sort is discussed in Section 7.2) that uses BinarySearch to find the position where the next insertion should take place.5. Write an algorithm that finds the greatest common divisor of two integers.6. Write an algorithm that finds both the smallest and largest numbers in a list of n numbers. Try tofind a method that does at most 1.5n comparisons of array items.7. Write an algorithm that determines whether or not an almost complete binary tree is a heap.
